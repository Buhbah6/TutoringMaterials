Assume a school is using an ArrayList of HashMaps to manage the grades of the students of
3 different classes

Here's what you need to know;

- There are 3 classes, each represented by a single HashMap for each
- In each class, there are 5 students, each being recorded by their name and grade
- You must populate the classes with each student, again only being recorded by
*NAME* and *GRADE*

What the school needs from you;

- Create a system where the user will select a class (1, 2, or 3)
- Show the user all the students in that class
- Allow the user to type the name of the student in the class that they would like
to retrieve the grade of
- Allow the user to select a different class if they wish to do so, or to exit the system

EX:

Class 1:
Anthony - 90
Shahe - 85
Giuliana - 99
Joe - 67
Gerald - 4
