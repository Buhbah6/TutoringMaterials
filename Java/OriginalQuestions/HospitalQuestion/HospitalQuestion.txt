Design a *BASIC* hospital waiting room system *USING PRIORITY QUEUE*

Tips:

- Create a patient class that will be the object contained within the queue
- Implement a priority system using either the Comparator or Comparable interfaces
- Create a Driver class where we will create some patients and test the system
- For testing, we can use both a regular queue, and a priority queue, where the 
patients will be inserted in the same order, and we can use an iteration structure
such as an iterator or a foreach to loop through and print the contents of each to see
how the priority aspect affects them.
